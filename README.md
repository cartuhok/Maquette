The Farnsworth House, brought to you by the fictitious FNM Architecture, highlights the use of advanced 3D live rendering techniques within an architectural context. The house, accompanying photos, and the entirety of the "FNM Architecture" brand, including its logo, are purely imaginative constructs. All assets are CC0.

For this project, I used React Three Fiber and Theatre.js to handle the camera animations. I created the scene in Blender, using some kitbashed BlenderKit assets to achieve the desired look. Additionally, I explored a new baking method in Blender with the SimpleBake addon. This approach saved a good amount of time spent on the baking process.

My dad is an architect. When I was little, he took me to his office one day and showed me one of the  models (also known as maquettes) he built. I was awestruck.  I remember peeking inside and imagining what it was like to be one of those little plastic people living in the world my dad meticulously crafted for them. This is my attempt at recreating that feeling in digital format.
